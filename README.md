# LunchWithFriends
USC CSCI201 Final Project (Fall 2020)
- LunchWithFriends is a web application designed to display and match users (USC students) interested in going to the same restaurants, from a database consisting of set restaurants located around USC.
- I worked on the backend, specifically on the server endpoint and webservlets for the chat functionality, along with further contributions in the webservlets connecting the frontend and backend, such as displaying the search results of a restaurant name from a database.
